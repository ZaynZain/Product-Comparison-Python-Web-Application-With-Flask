Built tough with rubber bumpers, reinforced ports and hinges, and a keyboard that can face whatever its users can dish out (see below), the 100e is compliant with MIL-STD-810G testing for all manner of shock and awe. It’s also drop-resistant up to 29.5 inches (75cm) – roughly the height of a school desk.Keyboard withstands all hands – even the spilling kind The full-sized keyboard includes a sealed touchpad and resists spills of up to 1.39 cups (330 ml). And its mechanically anchored keys stay put – no excuses for not doing the latest assignment!Collaborate from across the room or across the worldThe front-facing 720p HD camera makes it possible to capture multimedia creative projects from anywhere, in crystal-clear definition. Whether videoconferencing or talking to a classmate on Google Hangouts™, students will be seen clearly and completely, bringing students together to make learning a collaborative process.Homework never looked this goodStudents will spend a lot of time looking at the 11.6-inch HD screen; its antiglare technology reduces eye strain and allows them to look at it even longer. Good news and bad news, students – you can spend more time on your homework!Leave the charger at homeWith up to 10 hours of battery life, the 100e lasts an entire school day and more. Students can work a full day, bring it home, plug it in, and let it recharge overnight for the next day’s classes.Keeps students connectedWhether you need to connect to the internet or a peripheral device, the 100e will make it happen. It’s equipped with two USB-C ports, for powerful and fast connectivity to peripherals. USB-C connectors are smaller and reversible, making for quick connections without first having to check a connector’s orientation. They also can charge your Chromebook or your peripherals, providing power in addition to connectivity. The 100e also has two USB 3.0 ports, 2 x 2 AC WiFi, Bluetooth® 4.2, and a Micro SD card reader, so it can connect to just about anything a student needs.Share and sync with G Suite for EducationA suite of free productivity tools available on the 100e, G Suite for Education allows students and teachers to create and share with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Students and teachers can interact seamlessly and securely, staying synced across devices. Experience ultimate productivity: communicate your way, connecting via email, chat, or videoconference; collaborate anywhere, co-editing files in real time; and manage all of your tasks, building to-do lists, scheduling tests, and creating homework reminders. Bring cohesion to your online classroom.Chromebook fleet management a breeze with Chrome Education license School IT administrators, never fear! Chrome Education license offers more than 200 policies to fit your needs for managing your fleet of Chromebooks. You can update 100 or 100,000 devices without ever touching one of them. Create a personalized experience for users on each device. Choose auto-updates to get the latest security fixes, or manual updates for more control. Configure which applications and extensions teachers and students receive, and manage different plugins. You can even deploy a private web store with custom and curated apps, manage compatibility of older apps, and more.
